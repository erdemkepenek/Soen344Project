## Instruction on Running the Application on Local Machine
The application is composed of two components - the backend and frontend.
Both of these components must be running succesfully to use the working application Uber Santé.

Please make sure you have *Python*, and *React* installed on your machine.

### First Time Running the Application
The instruction below are given using the NPM package installer
#### Step 1: Running the Backend - Python with Flask

1. At the root of the project folder, run **pip install -r requirements.txt** to install the modules 
2. Still at the root of the project folder, run **python run.py** to start the backend server

#### Step 2: Running the Frontend - React
1. In the _front-end_ folder, run **npm install** to install the modules
2. Still in the _front-end_ folder, run **npm start** to start the front-end server. Once the front-end has been properly started, your default browser should open at the Uber Santé application link (wait a little at the blank white page)

#### Running the Application More Than Once
To run the application again, only follow the step 2 from Part 1 and 2 of the above instruction
